# Football Fan Hub

## Brief

A web application for following favorite football teams and staying updated with football-related content.

## Overview

I occasionally watch football matches and follow my favorite team. I regularly read news articles and reviews about past games, track my favorite team's fixtures, stay updated on transfers, and generally monitor what's happening with my team(s).

I want to create a web application that consolidates all of this information in one place for all the teams I'm interested in. My primary focus is Manchester United FC. Additionally, I want to stay informed about the Premier League (England) and the Israeli National Team. I need to know which tournaments my teams participate in, what stage they're at in those tournaments, and where they're positioned in tournament tables or playoff brackets.

I don't watch all of my favorite team's games, but after matches I want to have a quick overview. This should include information such as:
- Key players during the match
- The mood and atmosphere on the pitch
- Summary of goals scored
- Key moments and highlights during the game
- General impression of what happened in the match

## MVP Requirements

### Core Features

The application must include the following foundational capabilities:
- User authentication system
- Ability to select and follow favorite teams, leagues, players, managers and tournaments

### MVP Scope

For the initial MVP, the focus should be on following specific teams (e.g., Manchester United). Features related to players, leagues, managers, and tournaments should be implemented in future versions. The MVP architecture must be designed in a way that makes it easy to extend and add these features later.
